# Image to Brainfuck
This Flask application was made during a session of "Make an Arts Website" at the Recurse Center.

## What Is It?
It's a website, technically. It takes an image, and makes pseudo-ASCII art from it. Instead of the characters being from the ASCII set of characters, though, they are from the Brainfuck programming language. So theoretically, ImageToBrainfuck converts images into runnable code.
